# Overwatch Comp Finder

A quick experiment in Node, Express, and MongoDB.

Creates temporary Mongo records, and provides a frontend to help players discover roles their team composition needs. Made before Overwatch add LFG features, but never promoted or followed up on, but fun to make.

## Note this is (obviously) unmaintained and npm dependencies may be insecure/out-of-date.
